In the mornin you go gunnin' <br>

For the man who stole your water<br>

And you fire till he is done in<br>

But they catch you at the border<br>

And the mourners are all singin'<br>

As they drag you by your feet<br>

But the hangman isn't hangin'<br>

And they put you on the street<br>

CHORUS:<br>

You go back Jack do it again<br>

Wheel turnin' 'round and 'round<br>

You go back Jack do it again<br>

When you know she's no high climber<br>

Then you find your only friend<br>

In a room with your two timer<br>

And you're sure you're near the end<br>

Then you love a little wild one<br>

And she brings you only sorrow<br>

All the time you know she's smilin'<br>

You'll be on your knees tomorrow<br>

CHORUS<br>

Now you swear and kick and beg us<br>

That you're not a gamblin' man<br>

Then you find you're back in Vegas<br>

With a handle in your hand<br>

Your black cards can make you money<br>

So you hide them when you're able<br>

In the land of milk and honey<br>

You must put them on the table
